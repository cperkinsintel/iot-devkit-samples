# Onboard Blink 


## Introduction
This is a simple sample you could use for a quick test.

## What it is
A blink sample, it turns the on-board LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

## Hardware requirements

A board with an accesible GPIO pin (connected to an LED).

## Supported boards

This sample has been tested on
- MinnowBoard Turbot* 2.0
- Up Squared* board

The sample might need minor modifications depending on the board and shield you are using.

## Software requirements
This version of the sample has been tested on Ubuntu Linux. It requires the [mraa library](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa). 


## Setup
Create a new project on Intel(R) System Studio using this sample. Make sure the on board LED or the external LED is connected to the board.

## Note

Accessing device sensors, including LEDs, requires MRAA I/O operations. To avoid permission issues:

1. If you've already connected to your target, you'll need to kill the target tcf-agent and reboot the board before connecting with elevated privileges. More information is available [here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/developing-projects-with-intel-system-studio-c-creating-an-ssh-connection).

2. Connect to the target using passwordless (recommended) or with password-based SSH.

Passwordless Public Key-based Method (recommended):
First, generate the public keys. For instructions, see [Set up a new connection for your target](https://software.intel.com/en-us/developing-projects-with-intel-system-studio-c-2019-beta-creating-an-ssh-connection). 
Second, use the generated keys to connect to the target. For instructions, see [Login using public key](https://software.intel.com/en-us/developing-projects-with-intel-system-studio-c-2019-beta-connecting-to-target).

Password-based Method: 
Log in as the root user to connect to the target. For instructions, see [Authentication using password](https://software.intel.com/en-us/developing-projects-with-intel-system-studio-c-2019-beta-connecting-to-target). Because of security concerns, this method is not recommended.
